Hey there!

I'm a student applying to your Hackathon and I'm really hyped - but while I was applying I couldn't seem to find my University on your list! I go to the University of California, Merced - we're a pretty new school, but we're also pretty big - so I was wondering if you could add us up to your list, at least for next year! :)

Best,
